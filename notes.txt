Create a new repository on the command line

touch README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git
git push -u origin master
Push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git
git push -u origin master

Stuff to try:
I had a difficult time pushing data to the git repo until I typed:
git pull https://github.com/rlholland/gitnotes.git
This merged the remote with my local. I was able to push afterward. 

I have also deleted the remote repository after cloning it locally then
creating a remote empty repository and pushing back to it by typing
git push --set-upstream origin master

If you want to make another version of your files just make a branch. 
To create a new branch type: 
	git branch newbranchname
Git will automatically copy the master repo into your new branch.
Change into the new branch by typing:

	git checkout newbranchname

You can make changes without disturbing the master
files. If all goes well you can merge your changes into the master branch.

To merge your new branch into master, first go to the master branch
by typing: git checkout master

 then type:

	git merge branchname

The master branch will now have the same changes as branchname

If you want to delete the branch type:
	git branch -D branchname
