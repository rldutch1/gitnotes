Create a new repository on the command line

touch README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git
git push -u origin master
Push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git
git push -u origin master

Stuff to try:
I had a difficult time pushing data to the git repo until I typed:
git pull https://github.com/rlholland/gitnotes.git
This merged the remote with my local. I was able to push afterward.
